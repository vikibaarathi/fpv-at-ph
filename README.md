# FPV @ PH
#### Revision: 1.0.0
## A simple guideline for FPV quadcopter / drone pilots at PH

### Introduction
If you have arrived at this page, someone probably shared with you the location of the PH FPV Racing track. The original pilots who set up the track would fly there occasionally over weekends with just a handful of pilots, but now as the crowd has grown, this page would suggest some basic guidelines that could help keep things organized. While we would love to fly FPV at our own will and style, this page aims to promote some safety meassures for the residents nearby and pilots alike. Lets try to aim to do the following:

1. Watch everyone's safety around
2. Not be the source of disturbance to residents.
3. Promote a safe and fun hobby among pilots and residents. 

### Flight Times
- Noise from motors can travel quite far. Be sensisble when choosing times to fly such that it doesnt disturb the residents. 
- Preferabally no flights before 8:30 a.m. or after 7 p.m. 
- Respect prayer times and land your aircarft. 

### Location / Gates 
- Fly only within the big field area. 
- Do not fly in the playground facing the residentials 
- Dont go too close to the apartments on the right
- If you are first to arrive, open up the gates and tie them neatly
- If you are the last to leave, pull back all the gates
- If you crash into a gate, try to fix it. 
- If you cant fix it, pack the gates, remove broken pieces and store them at the side neatly.
- If you do try to fix using tape or new fabric, choose neutral colors such as white or light yellow / green as to not become an eye sore to the residents facing the field everyday. 

### Trash management
- Bring your own trash bags to collect your trash and throw it in the blue cans across the road, if it does not fit, bring it back with you for disposal.  
- Please collect all the trash especially broken props in the area and throw them in the blue cans accross the road
- Do not leave trash bags by the road. 

### Crowd (20 pax) and Noise Control
- Be sensible and logical. Not too loud music and not too much noise until it disturbes. Self judge the situation. Residents are probably trying to have a quiet weekend at home.
- Do not block the road by any means. Residents use the small road to drop off recyclable items. 
- Number of people around? For now let's say 20 is too huge of a crowd. Re-schedule or re-time your flight to avoid attention. 

### Before Flying Rules
- Make sure no other pilots are in the air when you plug in, even if on different channel or technology.
- Other than whoop style quads, no matter the size, must take off beyong the hill (Safety PVC).
- Check channels with others before flying.
- Notify all pilots that you are plugging in to ensure safety of other crafts , and provide a buffer window to respond if interference is noticed from others flying. Mention loudly your Band and Channel number before plugging in, ensure that all pilots has acknowledged you.

### Flight Rules
- Maximum of 4 aircraft in the air at one time. 
- Dont fly above/beyond the trees for non whoop quads. 
- Be mindful of flight times as to allow everyone to have fun as well. 
- Nobody stands beyond the safety line (PVC) when aircrafts in the air. Stop flights if pilots or members of public step in.
- Call out "Man on field", when someone walks the track during a flight

### Post Flight Rules
- Land beyond the hill (Safety PVC). 

### Social Media 
- Sharing footage is fine, but please refrain from sharing the exact location or address on social media. Your footage may include residentials and vehicles around the area and sharing location directly on a public forum would violate privacy. 

### Dan Lain Lain
- Basically if you think what you do would instil a little fear in those who dont know whats going on or distrubs the peace or harm the safetly of residents or fellow pilots, well basically dont do it. 
- If members of the public stop by to watch the flights, be kind and polite and welcome them. Share the excitement if possible but be mindful of everyone's safety

### Enforcement
- Everyone is encouraged to adhere by these simple rules and self regulate. 
- These are merely suggestions to keep the harmony and uphold the safety of everyone arround. 
- Suggestions are welcomed. Use the issues link on this page or communicate to the pilots at the field of your ideas. 

### Contribution & Donation
- Currently the gates are built and maintained by a few generous individuals. You are is welcome to donate gates, trash bags, flags, etc. 
- A fund will be set up for those who wish to chip in. To be determined. 

### Simulation Practice
 - Coming soon.

 ### Timing and Racing
 - Coming Soon.
